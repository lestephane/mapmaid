# User Guide
This guide walks you through the features of MapMaid, how to configure MapMaid, and how to get the most out of it.

Check out also our [Quick Start](QuickStart.md) if you only want to get started coding or take a look into the 
definition of [Custom Primitives](Concepts.md#custom-primitives) and 
[Serialized Objects](Concepts.md#serialized-objects) if you are wondering what those are.

## Configuring the MapMaid instance
MapMaid comes with a builder that allows you to configure how the Custom Primitives and Serialized Objects are 
detected, how they are (de)serialized, how they are (un)marshalled, how to handle exceptions. This section addresses 
all the possible configurations and how they impact the (de)serialization of your objects.
